before took about clifford algebra
we will see the meaning of  algebra in clifford algebra

in this context algebra mean the algebra structure


a bssic defenition of algebra structre is 

An algebraic structure consists of
a set of elements B
binary operators +, .
and a unary operator ‘

first we nedd at least two elements  in this stucture



if we can define these relations we can say we have an algebra


the hestoric of algebra began with eclid in five handread before creasmas hwo invented the real numbers and basc geomitric 

and after a long periode of slow development an italian named gardano introdoced complex numbers as a solution of .....

in one thaosend fourty hamilton invented a general form of complex number called quatrinios

in the same periode grasman published a new edition of his theory

this teary was very important for clifford to develop his algebra in ........

but unfortanly his works are ......... by gibbs tree dementional analysis , with we all learned in school 

and recently pauli and dirac did a great job to bring clifford algebra to the ,,,,,,,


as we mention before the quatrinios are a generalazed form of complex numbers

we allready know about the magic number i
in quatrinio algebra wa introduce j and k

which obey the multiplication rules:
